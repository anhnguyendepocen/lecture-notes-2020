## Overview

This course covers topics that range between data science, machine learning, and econometrics. In particular, it introduces concepts from the world of ML that can potentially contribute to empirical economics. The course exposes the students to popular supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, with an emphasis on the challenges and opportunities of integrating these methods in empirical economics, and the relevance of ML to policy analysis and causal inference. The various topics are illustrated through applications, reading empirical articles, and doing applied work.

## Learning objectives

Course participants will learn to:

1. Apply best-practices for data science in the context of empirical research in economics.

2. Develop an in-depth and practical knowledge of the challenges and opportunities that arise in applied empirical work that involves high dimensional data.

3. Integrate techniques and insights from the world of machine learning into applied empirical research in economics.


## Prework

Course participants are expected to:

1. Have R, RStudio, and Git installed on their own computers.
2. Sing up for a (free) DataCamp, GitHub, Rstudio Cloud, and Kaggle accounts.
